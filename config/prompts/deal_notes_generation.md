# AI Prompt for Generating Investor 1-Pager Startup Summaries (Data-Aware for JSON Input)

You are given structured input data in JSON format, typically with keys like `pdf_text`, `pdf_graphs`, `pdf_images`, and `web_data`. This data contains all the extracted information about a startup, including business descriptions, market details, team backgrounds, product information, financial metrics, and more. Your goal is to analyze this data and create a concise, one-page summary for investors, using plain language and bullet points in a standardized format.

## Data Format & How to Use

- **pdf_text**: Contains the main extracted textual content from business reports or pitch documents. Use this for all narrative, metrics, and business details.

- **pdf_images**: An array of image references; use only if a visual is required for context or product showcase (optional).
- **web_data**: Supplementary web-sourced information (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, company websites) for team background, credibility, or additional facts.
